data.mat is the preprocessed data. use the generate_data.m to process the data before run the py file.
generate_data.m will generate the computed pearon correlation matrix for THC and Placebo session.
In the computed data,  F1 is cognitive impaired and F2 is unimpaired.
The size of F1, F2 is:
Number of subjects*Augmented number* sliding window * features (20*20 for the cnn model, 400 for the fc model)

Please install tensorflow, keras to run this code

There are two models here.

train_test_fc.py is the model with fully connected layers and RNN.

Just simple run the code:

python train_test_fc.py to train and test the model.
