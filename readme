data.mat is the preprocessed data. It included computed dynamic brain network tensor F1 and F2.
data.mat can be downloaded here:

F1 is cognitive impaired and F2 is unimpaired.
The size of F1, F2 is:
Number of subjects*Augmented number* sliding window * features (20*20 for the cnn model, 400 for the fc model)

Please install tensorflow, keras to run this code

There are two models here.

train_test.py is the model with CNN & RNN combined (This model works best.). 

train_test_fc.py is the model with fully connected layers and RNN.

Just simple run the code:

python train_test.py to train and test the model.

You can change the training parameters in the file train_rnn.py or train_rnn_fc.py.

The data can be downloaded here.
